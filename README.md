### In order to learn fullstack programming, I come up with this project: a platform dedicated to album and song registration. Throughout this process, I gained knowledge in implementing and testing APIs and databases from scratch, as well as developing interfaces and deploying the application through a virtual machine.

**✿ goal:** develop a platform for independent artists to register albums and songs.

**✿ steps to develop the web application:**

1. prototype design using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/);
2. backend implementation with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) (RESTful API) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (database);
3. API testing using the [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/);
4. front-end implementation with [React](https://react.dev/) (web/desktop only);
5. virtual machine (VM) set up on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) for deployment.
